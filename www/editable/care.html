<h3 style="text-align:center">&nbsp;<strong>Care instructions</strong></h3>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The two most important elements for healthy terrariums is plenty of natural but indirect light and not overwatering.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>If the plants are growing straight and symmetrically, then the light level is correct. If they appear to be stretching towards the light then they will need to placed in a brighter spot. You could also periodically rotate the terrarium.</div>

<div><br />
When watering bear in mind that your terrarium does not have drainage holes, therefore be careful not to over water.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div>To keep your terrarium looking fantastic, clean the glass both inside and out with with a damp microfibre cloth occasionally.<br />
<br />
Over time some of the top layer of pebbles will sink into the soil so you can top up the pebbles a little once&nbsp;in awhile. You can get pebbles at Crazy Clark&#39;s and Bunnings for instance.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;Mineral&nbsp;residue from tap water will build up along the rim of the soil eventually. You can use a skewer stick wrapped in paper towel to clean this off.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>It is advisable to remove the embellishments when watering your terrarium to prevent mold. This only takes a moment.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The following care instructions will ensure good health and longevity.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Open terrariums</strong></h3>

<div><strong><u>Leafy plant terrariums</u></strong><br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div>Watering.<br />
These plants require a little more watering than succulents. Water approximately once every week or two, just enough to wet the soil but do not overwater.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;Light.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Bright indirect light. Never place in direct light as the light penetrating the glass will magnify and burn the plants.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;Pruning.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Give the plants a trim if they begin to outgrow the glass space. You may need to replace some of the plants with smaller varieties or less established plants at some point.&nbsp;</div>

<div><br />
<u><strong>â€‹Moss</strong></u><br />
<br />
If your open terrarium includes a carpet of&nbsp;moss, in addition to the usual watering, spray the moss lightly every few days.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<h4><u>Succulents and cacti terrariums</u></h4>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;Watering.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Only water enough to wet, not soak the soil and only once the soil has become dry. Succulents do not tolerate over watering so it is best to err on the side of caution.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;Light.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Bright indirect light. Never place in direct sunlight as the light penetrating the glass will magnify and burn the plants.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Pruning.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Give the plants a trim if they begin to outgrow the glass space. You may need to replace some of the plants with smaller varieties or less established plants at some point.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Closed terrariums&nbsp;</h3>

<div>Closed terrariums usually only incorportate moss and leafy green plants, and are quite self regulating as the water is recycled in the closed environment.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div>Watering.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Closed terrariums require very little watering. Add a little water to wet not drench the soil every couple of months.&nbsp;<br />
If you over-water condensation will form so leave the lid off the terrarium for a few days or week or&nbsp;until the soil has dried&nbsp;somewhat.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;Light.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Bright indirect light. Never place in direct light as the light penetrating the glass will magnify and burn the plants.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;Pruning.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Give the plants a trim if they begin to outgrow the glass space. You may need to replace some of the plants with smaller varieties or less established plants at some point.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Air plant terrariums</h3>

<div>Air plants have different care conditions to other plants.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;Watering.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Remove air plant from vessel and immerse the whole plant in a bowl of water for up to 8 hours every 2 weeks or so. In summer also mist spray the plant every second day or so.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;Light.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Bright indirect light. Never place in direct light as the light penetrating the glass will magnify and burn the plants.</div>
