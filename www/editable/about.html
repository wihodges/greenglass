green glass was established in 2012 by Julie van Oosten who is passionate about terrariums and the endless creative and aesthetic possibilities they hold. Using a combination of natural and man made materials, Julie has become a collector of embellishments, and has developed a fascination for the diversity of plants, especially succulents and semi tropical plants.
