<h4>How long until ordered and bespoke pieces will be&nbsp;available?</h4>

<div>I prefer approximately 4 weeks to ensure availability of plants and embellishments and also to ensure&nbsp;that the plants survive and thrive after being transplanted. However, some&nbsp;orders can be available within&nbsp;a few days if time and availability permits.&nbsp;</div>
