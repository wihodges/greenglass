Tropical plant terrariums (bold)
Watering. 
These plants require a little more watering than succulents. Water approximately once every week or two,  just enough to wet the soil but do not overwater.
Light. 
Bright indirect light. Never place in direct light as the light penetrating the glass will magnify and burn the plants.
Pruning.
 Give the plants a trim if they begin to outgrow the glass space. You may need to replace some of the plants with smaller varieties or less established plants at some point.

Please don't forget to clean the glass both inside and out with with a microfibre cloth occasionally. Clean glass makes the terrarium look even more.

It is advisable to remove the embellishments when watering to prevent mold. This only takes a moment.
